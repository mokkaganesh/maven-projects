spring mvc: 

servlet : create servlet class then client sends a request to server.

spring mvc :

we have controller (means in every class in servlet) ->login logout add sun mul

when client sends the request goes to web.xml file -> for which request which controller we need 

->each servlet is considered as one controller  convert to spring mvc;
->all controller wil be handeled by fromt controller (this is dispatcher servlet )

-> all the request goes to dispatcher servlet (by mapping in web.xml file)

-> ok now request is for add , then we have call add controller ====> one issue which one to call not a superman.

->means dispatcher servlet ->needs a config file we have mention which request goes to which controller.

->with the help of @controller annotation.(every controller will have mapping) just doing give package name.

->means that controller will give the lots of pages (web page).

->first dispatcher servlet request the controller ->it will return the conroller send response to the dispatcher

-> now we have 2 things data and view name;
